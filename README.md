# sappho
Original platformer game created for my Literature Humanities final project inspired by Sappho's poetry. \n
Because the game was created in GameMaker Studio 2, and because I unfortunately do not currently have a license to properly export the project, you will need GameMaker in order to open it and play it. \n
To Do: \n
- Add individual code/sprites to this folder so they can be readily examined w/o using GameMaker \n
- Take this code and convert into another language that can be more relevant to github, such as Python \n
